      "checked out for up to 60 days. Check for overdue checkouts is done by taking a look at\n",
      "daily sheet with overdue checkouts. Patron interacts with his/her current holds, checkouts, etc.\n",

      "During the session we discovered following definitions:  \n",
      "![Event Storming Definitions](docs/images/eventstorming-definitions.png)    \n",
      "\n",
      "This made us think of real life scenarios that might happen. We discovered them described with the help of\n",
      "the **Example mapping**:  \n",
      "![Example mapping](docs/images/example-mapping.png)  \n",
      "\n",
      "This in turn became the base for our *Design Level* sessions, where we analyzed each example:  \n",

      "### Project structure and architecture\n",
      "At the very beginning, not to overcomplicate the project, we decided to assign each bounded context\n",
      "to a separate package, which means that the system is a modular monolith. There are no obstacles, though,\n",
      "to put contexts into maven modules or finally into microservices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bounded contexts should (amongst others) introduce autonomy in the sense of architecture. Thus, each module\n",
      "encapsulating the context has its own local architecture aligned to problem complexity.\n",
      "In the case of a context, where we identified true business logic (**lending**) we introduced a domain model\n",
      "that is a simplified (for the purpose of the project) abstraction of the reality and utilized\n",
      "hexagonal architecture. In the case of a context, that during Event Storming turned out to lack any complex\n",
      "domain logic, we applied CRUD-like local architecture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "![Architecture](docs/images/architecture-big-picture.png) \n",
      "\n",
      "If we are talking about hexagonal architecture, it lets us separate domain and application logic from\n",
      "frameworks (and infrastructure). What do we gain with this approach? Firstly, we can unit test most important\n",
      "part of the application - **business logic** - usually without the need to stub any dependency.\n",
      "Secondly, we create ourselves an opportunity to adjust infrastructure layer without the worry of\n",
      "breaking the core functionality. In the infrastructure layer we intensively use Spring Framework\n",
      "as probably the most mature and powerful application framework with an incredible test support.\n",
      "More information about how we use Spring you will find [here](#spring).\n",
      "\n",
      "As we already mentioned, the architecture was driven by Event Storming sessions. Apart from identifying\n",
      "contexts and their complexity, we could also make a decision that we separate read and write models (CQRS).\n",
      "As an example you can have a look at **Patron Profiles** and *Daily Sheets*.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Aggregates\n",
      "Aggregates discovered during Event Storming sessions communicate with each other with events. There is\n",
      "a contention, though, should they be consistent immediately or eventually? As aggregates in general\n",
      "determine business boundaries, eventual consistency sounds like a better choice, but choices in software\n",
      "are never costless. Providing eventual consistency requires some infrastructural tools, like message broker\n",
      "or event store. That's why we could (and did) start with immediate consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Good architecture is the one which postpones all important decisions\n",
      "\n",
      "... that's why we made it easy to change the consistency model, providing tests for each option, including\n",
      "basic implementations based on **DomainEvents** interface, which can be adjusted to our needs and\n",
      "toolset in future. Let's have a look at following examples:\n",

      "    @AllArgsConstructor\n",
      "    public class StoreAndForwardDomainEventPublisher implements DomainEvents {\n",
      "    \n",
      "        private final JustForwardDomainEventPublisher justForwardDomainEventPublisher;\n",
      "        private final EventsStorage eventsStorage;\n",
      "    \n",
      "        @Override\n",
      "        public void publish(DomainEvent event) {\n",

      "            eventsStorage.published(domainEvents);\n",
      "        }\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "To clarify, we should always aim for aggregates that can handle a business operation atomically\n",
      "(transactionally if you like), so each aggregate should be as independent and decoupled from other\n",
      "aggregates as possible. Thus, eventual consistency is promoted. As we already mentioned, it comes\n",
      "with some tradeoffs, so from the pragmatic point of view immediate consistency is also a choice.\n",
      "You might ask yourself a question now: _What if I don't have any events yet?_. Well, a pragmatic\n",
      "approach would be to encapsulate the communication between aggregates in a _Service-like_ class,\n",
      "where you could call proper aggregates line by line explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Events\n",
      "Talking about inter-aggregate communication, we must remember that events reduce coupling, but don't remove\n",
      "it completely. Thus, it is very vital to share(publish) only those events, that are necessary for other\n",
      "aggregates to exist and function. Otherwise there is a threat that the level of coupling will increase\n",
      "introducing **feature envy**, because other aggregates might start using those events to perform actions\n",
      "they are not supposed to perform. A solution to this problem could be the distinction of domain events\n",
      "and integration events, which will be described here soon.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Events in Repositories \n",
      "Repositories are one of the most popular design pattern. They abstract our domain model from data layer. \n",
      "In other words, they deal with state. That said, a common use-case is when we pass a new state to our repository,\n",
      "so that it gets persisted. It may look like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "public class BusinessService {\n",
      "   \n",
      "    private final PatronRepository patronRepository;\n",
      "    \n",
      "    void businessMethod(PatronId patronId) {\n",
      "        Patron patron = patronRepository.findById(patronId);\n",
      "        //do sth\n",
      "        patronRepository.save(patron);\n",
      "    }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Conceptually, between 1st and 3rd line of that business method we change state of our Patron from A to B. \n",
      "This change might be calculated by dirty checking or we might just override entire Patron state in the database. \n",
      "Third option is _Let's make implicit explicit_ and actually call this state change A->B an **event**. \n",
      "After all, event-driven architecture is all about promoting state changes as domain events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to this our domain model may become immutable and just return events as results of invoking a command like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "public BookPlacedOnHold placeOnHold(AvailableBook book) {\n",
      "      ...\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "And our repository might operate directly on events like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "public interface PatronRepository {\n",
      "     void save(PatronEvent event) {\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the main components of a successful project is technical leadership that lets the team go in the right\n",
      "direction. Nevertheless, there are tools that can support teams in keeping the code clean and protect the\n",
      "architecture, so that the project won't become a Big Ball of Mud, and thus will be pleasant to develop and\n",

      "### Functional thinking\n",
      "When you look at the code you might find a scent of functional programming. Although we do not follow\n",
      "a _clean_ FP, we try to think of business processes as pipelines or workflows, utilizing functional style through\n",
      "following concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Please note that this is not a reference project for FP._\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Immutable objects\n",
      "Each class that represents a business concept is immutable, thanks to which we:\n",
      "* provide full encapsulation and objects' states protection,\n",
      "* secure objects for multithreaded access,\n",
      "* control all side effects much clearer. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Pure functions\n",
      "We model domain operations, discovered in Design Level Event Storming, as pure functions, and declare them in\n",
      "both domain and application layers in the form of Java's functional interfaces. Their implementations are placed\n",
      "in infrastructure layer as ordinary methods with side effects. Thanks to this approach we can follow the abstraction\n",
      "of ubiquitous language explicitly, and keep this abstraction implementation-agnostic. As an example, you could have\n",

      "#### Type system\n",
      "_Type system - like_ modelling - we modelled each domain object's state discovered during EventStorming as separate\n",
      "classes: `AvailableBook`, `BookOnHold`, `CheckedOutBook`. With this approach we provide much clearer abstraction than\n",
      "having a single `Book` class with an enum-based state management. Moving the logic to these specific classes brings\n",
      "Single Responsibility Principle to a different level. Moreover, instead of checking invariants in every business method\n",
      "we leave the role to the compiler. As an example, please consider following scenario: _you can place on hold only a book\n",
      "that is currently available_. We could have done it in a following way:\n",
      "```java\n",
      "public Either<BookHoldFailed, BookPlacedOnHoldEvents> placeOnHold(Book book) {\n",
      "  if (book.status == AVAILABLE) {  \n",
      "      ...\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "but we use the _type system_ and declare method of following signature\n",
      "```java\n",
      "public Either<BookHoldFailed, BookPlacedOnHoldEvents> placeOnHold(AvailableBook book) {\n",
      "      ...\n",
      "}\n",
      "```  \n",
      "The more errors we discover at compile time the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet another advantage of applying such type system is that we can represent business flows and state transitions\n",
      "with functions much easier. As an example, following functions:\n",
      "```\n",
      "placeOnHold: AvailableBook -> BookHoldFailed | BookPlacedOnHold\n",
      "cancelHold: BookOnHold -> BookHoldCancelingFailed | BookHoldCanceled\n",
      "``` \n",
      "are much more concise and descriptive than these:\n",
      "```\n",
      "placeOnHold: Book -> BookHoldFailed | BookPlacedOnHold\n",
      "cancelHold: Book -> BookHoldCancelingFailed | BookHoldCanceled\n",
      "```\n",
      "as here we have a lot of constraints hidden within function implementations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover if you think of your domain as a set of operations (functions) that are being executed on business objects\n",
      "(aggregates) you don't think of any execution model (like async processing). It is fine, because you don't have to.\n",
      "Domain functions are free from I/O operations, async, and other side-effects-prone things, which are put into the\n",
      "infrastructure layer. Thanks to this, we can easily test them without mocking mentioned parts. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Monads\n",
      "Business methods might have different results. One might return a value or a `null`, throw an exception when something\n",
      "unexpected happens or just return different objects under different circumstances. All those situations are typical\n",
      "to object-oriented languages like Java, but do not fit into functional style. We are dealing with this issues\n",
      "with monads (monadic containers provided by [Vavr](https://www.vavr.io)):\n",
      "* When a method returns optional value, we use the `Option` monad:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```java\n",
      "    Option<Book> findBy(BookId bookId) {\n",
      "        ...\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "* When a method might return one of two possible values, we use the `Either` monad:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```java\n",
      "    Either<BookHoldFailed, BookPlacedOnHoldEvents> placeOnHold(AvailableBook book) {\n",
      "        ...\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "* When an exception might occur, we use `Try` monad:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```java\n",
      "    Try<Result> placeOnHold(@NonNull PlaceOnHoldCommand command) {\n",
      "        ...\n",
      "    }\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to this, we can follow the functional programming style, but we also enrich our domain language and\n",
      "make our code much more readable for the clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Pattern Matching\n",
      "Depending on a type of a given book object we often need to perform different actions. Series of if/else or switch/case statements\n",
      "could be a choice, but it is the pattern matching that provides the most conciseness and flexibility. With the code\n",
      "like below we can check numerous patterns against objects and access their constituents, so our code has a minimal dose\n",
      "of language-construct noise:\n",
      "```java\n",
      "private Book handleBookPlacedOnHold(Book book, BookPlacedOnHold bookPlacedOnHold) {\n",
      "    return API.Match(book).of(\n",
      "        Case($(instanceOf(AvailableBook.class)), availableBook -> availableBook.handle(bookPlacedOnHold)),\n",
      "        Case($(instanceOf(BookOnHold.class)), bookOnHold -> raiseDuplicateHoldFoundEvent(bookOnHold, bookPlacedOnHold)),\n",
      "        Case($(), () -> book)\n",
      "    );\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### (No) ORM\n",
      "If you run `mvn dependency:tree` you won't find any JPA implementation. Although we think that ORM solutions (like Hibernate)\n",
      "are very powerful and useful, we decided not to use them, as we wouldn't utilize their features. What features are\n",
      "talking about? Lazy loading, caching, dirty checking. Why don't we need them? We want to have more control\n",
      "over SQL queries and minimize the object-relational impedance mismatch ourselves. Moreover, thanks to relatively\n",
      "small aggregates, containing as little data as it is required to protect the invariants, we don't need the\n",
      "lazy loading mechanism either.\n",
      "With Hexagonal Architecture we have the ability to separate domain and persistence models and test them\n",
      "independently. Moreover, we can also introduce different persistence strategies for different aggregates. \n",
      "In this project, we utilize both plain SQL queries and `JdbcTemplate` and use new and very promising \n",
      "project called Spring Data JDBC, that is free from the JPA-related overhead mentioned before.\n",
      "Please find below an example of a repository:\n",
